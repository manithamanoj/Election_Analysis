# Election Audit Summary
  From this election analysis we can understand the voting percentage of each county. So in future we can adopt different methods to analyze and understand the importance of voting and encourage more people to vote. This analysis can also be used for future campaigning.

  The script can be used for any election by making required modifications. For example for federal election we can compare the results of states instead of county. 
  
  One more things we could have added is to analyze the vote percentage for each candidate in each county to understand the voting trend, which will be very helpful for future campaigning.
