Pypoll

## Project Overview
   A Colarado board of Elections employee has given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congresional election. In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:

     *A complete list of candidates who received votes
     *Total number of votes each candidate received
     *Percentage of votes each candidate won
     *The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Challenge Overview

 The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

## Election Audit Summary
  From this election analysis we can understand the voting percentage of each county. So in future we can adopt different methods to analyze and understand the importance of voting and encourage more people to vote. This analysis can also be used for future campaigning.

  The script can be used for any election by making required modifications. For example for federal election we can compare the results of states instead of county. 
  
  One more things we could have added is to analyze the vote percentage for each candidate in each county to understand the voting trend, which will be very helpful for future campaigning.
